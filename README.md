## Instructions

The project is a feedreader that loads RSS from :
- Udacity
- css-tricks.com
- developers.google.com
- soundcloud.com

## Functionality
- A user selects a thematic option from the menu, the subject/article of interest and then is redirected to the source feed.

## Jasmine Functionality - Testing

- To test our code functionality we run the below test using jasmine.

- Ensure that RSS Feeds are working properly.
- Ensure that RSS Feeds are defined.
- Ensure RSS urls & names are defined and not empty.
- Ensure that "the menu" is hidden by default and appears when the icon is clicked.
- Ensure that there is at least one RSS entry and that when we change category, a new feeder is loaded.

## Contributing

- Additional testing methods to further ensure functionality.
